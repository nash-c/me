TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Worked through exercise 0, exercise 1, exercise 2, and exercise 3.
Exercise 0 --> starting with adding numbers together, turning string to uppercase, then combining a string and integer
Exercise 1 --> annotating what I think a function would do vs. what it actually did
Exercise 2 --> fixing the code so it's correct and doesn't cause any errors when running
Exercise 3 --> a bunch of activities that got progressively harder
                is_odd, fix_it, loops_1a, loops_1c and loops_2 were pretty okay, fully doable 
                loops_3 and onwards were pretty hellish, but I made it through ðŸ˜­
                lowkey loops_7 was kind of confusing --> look over it again for further clarity
