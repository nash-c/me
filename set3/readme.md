TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Worked through exercise 1. I found it pretty fun and was able to work through it pretty well!
Looked through exercise 2 and played the guessing game --> tried to understand why it worked
Exercise 3 --> took the code from exercise 2 and exercise 1 and modified it to work for exercise 3, I passed the test
Exercise 4 was kinda weird, but if it passes the tests it passes the test
